        <h1>Exploring Unity Render Feature</h1>

        <p>As we all know, URP (Universal Render Pipeline) Shading is single-pass. The default Pass needs to be written
            under the LightMode of UniversalForward. In previous pipelines, to render double-sided transparent
            materials, two passes were typically used, rendering the back face first and then the front face. But how
            can we achieve this effect in URP? Modifying the pipeline is certainly possible, and URP's logic is quite
            simple. However, changing the pipeline specifically for this special effect reduces flexibility and is not a
            good solution. This is where we introduce a very cool feature in URP - RenderFeature.</p>

        <p>RenderFeature allows flexible insertion of command buffers at various stages of rendering. The insertion
            point is determined by RenderPassEvent, as shown in the following image:</p>

        <img src="render-pass-events.png"
            alt="render pass events">

        <p>It's incredibly detailed, as you can see.</p>

        <p>Now, I'll use RenderFeature to implement a double-sided transparent material by inserting a Pass.</p>

        <p>First, prepare a Shader. I directly copied Lit.shader here. Then add a Pass at the beginning to render the
            back face. The shading for both back and front faces is the same, so I copied UniversalForward directly and
            set Culling to Front. Finally, define your own LightMode; I wrote it as BackFace here.</p>

        <img src="render-states.png"
            alt="render states">

        <p>I must say, the URP source code comments are quite good, making it easy to understand the rendering logic.
        </p>

        <p>Next, create a RenderFeature. In the Project, go to Create -> Rendering -> Universal Render Pipeline ->
            Renderer Feature. There's already a template here. We need to pay attention to the Pass inside. The Execute
            method is where you write your command buffer. I'll take another shortcut and copy the code from
            DrawObjectPass. This is the Pass for rendering Universal Forward. The logic for back and front faces is the
            same, only the Pass used is different, so change the ShaderTagId to "BackFace". Since the back face is only
            applicable to transparent cases, set the RenderQueueRange to transparent. Set the insertion point
            RenderPassEvent to BeforeRendingTransparents to ensure it renders before transparent objects.</p>

        <img src="render-feature-pass.png"
            alt="render feature pass">

        <p>This is the entire logic.</p>

        <p>Find your Forward Renderer or create a new one. Add the RenderFeature you just wrote to it. Then find the
            Render Pipeline Asset (in Project Setting -> Graphics), and add the Renderer you just created to the
            RendererList. Finally, select the renderer with the render feature for your camera, and you'll be able to
            see the effect in the Game window. Currently, it seems RenderFeature only works in the Game view. By setting
            Default in the URP Asset, you can see the same effect in the Scene View as in the Game View.</p>

        <p>Below is a comparison of effects. On the left is a forced two-sided rendering of transparency, and on the
            right is the multi-pass transparency effect achieved through the above method.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="demo-scene.png"

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The texture is from Lele Feng's "Unity Shader Essentials". You can see that on the left, because the front
            and back faces are rendered in one Pass, the order is not distinguished, resulting in chaotic front-back
            relationships. On the right, the rendering order of front and back faces is separated, resulting in the
            correct display effect.</p>

        <p>The function of Render Feature is essentially to give TAs and graphics programmers more flexibility to extend
            URP by inserting Passes. Although URP is somewhat rudimentary, its code logic and comments are quite clear.
            It's a very good resource for beginners to learn about rendering pipelines. URP doesn't seem to be very
            popular even though it's been out for so long. Some people see the comparison with built-in RP, notice that
            many features are missing, and think it's nothing but lightweight, unwilling to use it. In fact, through
            RenderFeature and code modifications, URP can absolutely achieve more and better effects than built-in RP.
            Don't wait for the official implementation of features; Unity is getting further and further away on the AAA
            path, which I would call sick.</p>

        <p>Finally, let me show another clever use of RenderFeature. This one is used to display the depth texture on
            the screen.</p>

        <img src="bonus.png" alt="bonus">
        <img src="bonus-shaders.png"
            alt="bonus shaders">

        <p>This is a common full-screen Blit similar to post-processing. The Shader is simpler, just outputting the
            relevant Buffer.</p>

        <p>Then create a renderer for the corresponding RenderFeature and add it to the pipeline. This way, you can
            switch renderers in the camera to display different buffers.</p>
