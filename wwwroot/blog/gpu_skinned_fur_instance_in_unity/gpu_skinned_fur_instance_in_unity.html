    <h1>GPU Skinned Fur Instance in Unity</h1>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>As we all know, the most common method for fur simulation is Shell Based Fur. Simply put, it expands vertices
        along
        the normal direction to form stacked shells, and then uses a Noise texture as a fur pattern to create the fur
        shape
        through hollowing (Clip or Blend). The basic principles and shading methods have been widely discussed on the
        internet, so we won't go into detail here. The focus of this article is to introduce a GPU Instance
        implementation
        that supports Skinned Mesh in Unity.</p>

    <h2>Limitations:</h2>
    <p>The most significant problem with Shell Based fur is the exponential increase in the number of faces. On desktop
        platforms, a decent animal fur effect usually uses the Alpha Clip method, requiring at least 100 layers to avoid
        discontinuities. This is completely unrealistic on mobile platforms, where 8-16 layers are more reasonable.
        However,
        this leads to discontinuities, so Alpha Blend must be used, which also avoids breaking Early Z optimization.</p>

    <p>Another issue is how to draw the Shell. The desktop method is to pre-generate, with controllable thickness and
        growth
        direction. This information, along with the number of layers, is written into VertexColor or UV, and drawn in
        one
        pass. The mobile approach uses multiple passes. Pre-generation is always an extra step for artists, and even if
        it
        can be automated through tools, brushing additional information like growth direction is troublesome. With fewer
        layers, the actual effect is not very noticeable, and the file size increases exponentially, so it's completely
        unnecessary. Moreover, URP doesn't support multiple passes by default, so you either need to use multiple
        material
        balls to implement multiple passes or extend the pipeline with RenderFeature, both of which are quite
        cumbersome.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>
    <p>With high face count, multiple passes, and repeated drawing, this is clearly a case where GPU Instance can be
        used
        for optimization. Obtain the Mesh of the fur model, write the number of layers into the Material Block, and <a
            href="#ref1" class="reference">use
            DrawMeshInstanced for drawing</a>. However, Unity's skinned mesh renderer doesn't support GPU Instance.
        Although
        there are some workarounds, such as BakeMesh or <a href="#ref2" class="reference">Animation
            Instancing</a>, they each have their own issues.</p>

    <p><a href="#ref3" class="reference">Unity added
            SkinnedMeshRenderer.GetVertexBuffer in 2021.2.0</a>, which perfectly solves the long-standing SkinnedMesh
        Instance problem. Therefore, the process is to get the VertexBuffer and set it to the Material, draw using
        DrawProcedual, and SV_InstanceID represents the current layer number.</p>

    <h2>Implementation:</h2>
    <p>This solution uses Unity 2021.2.6f1.</p>

    <p>First, use GetVertexBuffer() to get the vertex Buffer after skinning. Note that only position, normal, and
        tangent
        attributes are obtained here. UV and Index need to be obtained from the mesh.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>For a mesh to be compatible with a <a
                href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/SkinnedMeshRenderer.html">SkinnedMeshRenderer</a>,
            it must have multiple vertex streams: one for deformed data (positions, normals, tangents), one for static
            data
            (colors and texture coordinates), and one for skinning data (blend weights and blend indices).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Set the Buffer to the material.</p>

    <img src="Untitled.png" alt="Setting Buffer to material">

    <p>Then, perform the drawing. For ease of control, I wrote the number of layers into the Material, which needs to be
        read out here as the number of Instances.</p>

    <img src="Untitled%201.png" alt="Drawing process">

    <p>Finally, for the Shader part, because we're using Procedural drawing, we can only read vertices from the Buffer
        using
        SV_VertexID and SV_InstanceID. Note that the Buffer here can only be ByteAddressBuffer, so we need to manually
        <a href="#ref4" class="reference">parse</a> it.
    </p>

            or
            ::Vertex buffers to also be <a

        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Note: Because we're using Procedural drawing, we don't need to enable #pragma multi_compile_instancing.
        Therefore,
        UNITY_ANY_INSTANCING_ENABLED is undefined, and there's no need to use macros from UnityInstancing.</p>

    <h2>Result:</h2>

    <p>Finally, Shell Fur Shading with any number of layers can be achieved with a single Pass. There's no need to
        pre-generate meshes, the number of layers can be adjusted dynamically, and it supports Skinned Mesh GPU
        Instance.
        All of this requires only one DrawCall.</p>

    <h2>Extension:</h2>
    <p>Since we're getting the vertex buffer after skinning, in addition to Animation Instance, we can also blend <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDRDA-Q8LuY">skinned animations</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/SkinnedMeshRenderer.html">2021.2.0</a> not
        only provides the vertex cache after skinning but also provides the cache from the previous frame.</p>

    <img src="Untitled%204.png" alt="Previous frame cache">

    <p>Based on this, we can simulate the physical effects of fur in CS. Through DrawProceduralIndirect, we can also set
        the
        number of layers based on distance, achieving automatic LOD.</p>
